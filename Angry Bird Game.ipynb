    "Using, physics equations and concepts you can code the trajectory of a projectile and the subsequent motion when it hits a target. These equations and concepts include, momentum, torque, equations of motion and newtons laws. These equations and concepts will be used to code the trajectory of a 'bird' and also what happens if it hits a tall, rectangular target. The user will be able to input their own initial conditions of velocity and angle of trajectory with the aim of toppling the target. "

    "I would make improvements to the physics of this game by adding resistive forces. For example, adding air resistance by including a constant opposing force in the motion equations. This force would increase as the speed of the bird increases. Also, I would include friction between the bird and the target. This would mean, that some momentum would be lost, therefore I would code a momentum transfer to the target that is less than the momentum of the bird. Furthermore, I would not assume that all of the momentum is transferred. Instead, I would use the concept of coefficient of restitution in the equations of momentum. This would tell us the respective momentums of the bird and the target, after the collision."
